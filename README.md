   - Display the rolled values on the dice faces.
   - Play a sound effect to mimic the sound of rolling dice when the button is clicked.

4. **Sound Effects:**
   - Include a sound effect file (e.g., "rolling-dice.mp3") that mimics the sound of dice being rolled.
   - Load and play this sound effect when the "Roll the Dice" button is clicked.

## Functionality
